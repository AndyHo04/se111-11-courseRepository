        <p style="border:2px solid green;"> My name is  <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Andy Ho</span> and I am a <u>19 year old</u> who goes to New England Tech. My family is from <span style="font-style: italic">Vietnam</span> and I was given birth in Rhode Island by my parents who met and came to Rhode Island together. I like to workout, read, and play video games. What I hope my future looks like is i hope I am a software engineer working at a company, having a stable life and income, and providing for my family since they raised me so I hope to give back to them.
